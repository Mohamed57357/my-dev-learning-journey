# My Software Development Journey

## üìñ Overview

Welcome to my personal software development journey! This repository is a journal of my growth as a developer, documenting my experiences, the projects I‚Äôve worked on, the problems I‚Äôve solved, and the skills I‚Äôve developed over time. Whether you‚Äôre just starting out or are an experienced developer, I hope you find inspiration and valuable insights in my journey.

## üéØ Goals

- *Become a Proficient .NET Full-Stack Developer*: Focus on building both desktop and web applications using .NET technologies.
- *Master Clean Code and High-Performance Practices*: Ensure that my code is not only functional but also clean, efficient, and maintainable.
- *Explore Different Programming Paradigms*: Dive deep into object-oriented programming (OOP), functional programming, and other paradigms to enhance my coding versatility.
- *Build and Contribute to Open Source Projects*: Learn through collaboration and contribution to the open-source community.

## üöÄ My Learning Path

### 1. *Programming Fundamentals*
   - Focused on learning the basics of programming with languages like *C++* and *C#*.
   - Worked on numerous problem-solving exercises to strengthen logical thinking and coding skills.

### 2. *Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming*
   - Developed a *Bank System* project using functional programming and then rewrote it using OOP principles to understand the differences and benefits of each approach.

### 3. *Web Development with .NET*
   - Created several desktop applications using *.NET Framework* to understand the fundamentals of building robust, scalable software.
   - Currently learning *ASP.NET* to transition into web development and create dynamic, interactive web applications.

### 4. *Databases and SQL*
   - Learned relational database design and implemented multiple *relational schemas* using SQL Server.
   - Focused on writing efficient SQL queries and understanding database optimization techniques.

### 5. *Clean Code and Best Practices*
   - Studied clean code principles to ensure code readability, maintainability, and performance.
   - Continuously refactor my projects to apply these best practices.

## üìù Projects

Here are some of the key projects I‚Äôve worked on:

- *Bank System* (Functional Programming)
- *ATM System* (Functional Programming)
- *Bank System* (OOP)
- *Desktop Applications with .NET*
- *Web Applications with ASP.NET*
- *SQL Relational Schemas*

## üìö Resources and Learning Materials

Throughout my journey, I‚Äôve utilized a variety of resources that have significantly contributed to my learning:

- *Books*: "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin Explained by CodeBuster Youtube Channel
- *Online Courses*: Programming Advices
- *Community Forums*: Programming Advices, Stack Overflow

## üå± What‚Äôs Next?

- Deep dive into *ASP.NET Core* to build robust backend services.
- Learn more advanced *Data Structures and algorithms* to be able to create more and more efficient applications.
- Master *HTML* and *CSS* and use them to create *Responsive Web Pages*
- Learn more about *JavaScript* and *modern JavaScript frameworks* like React or Angular to enhance frontend skills.
- Continue contributing to open source and collaborative projects.
